# mefocus
Final project

Description: an app that encourage users to not using their cell phones for a while to stay focus on whatever they want to do: learning, working, going out, playing with friends,…

What is it supposed to do?
- Main view:
   - Measure phone usage time (?)
   - User can set up a timer and a goal: work, learn, play sport, rest, etc
   - Display timer counting down
   - If user minimize/exit the app, timer stops, display some notification/message to user
   - Provide encouraging messages that can be customized by user
- Statistic view on day/week/month/year:
   - Hours saved (bar chart)
   - Time spent for activity (pie chart)
- Setting:
   - Allow phone call (limit to 5 mins?)
   - Allow music (with warning)

Optional:
- User can user photos for background
- User can use recorded voice to make stronger messages
- Interact with others: ask a family member/friend/boss to manage one’s progress: the managers will receive notification with a specific time on the owner’s give-up 
   - In case of no wifi: save the time that the use gives up to send later when wifi is available
- Share statistic on social network (Facebook, Twitter)
- Leaderboard: ranking among friends or in the world
- Very optional: pet raising: 
   - Choose a pet to raise
   - For each time not using your phone, you’ll earn some food to feed your pet, and some gold to buy more food, toys, or playgrounds for your pet
   - Your pet will show status of happiness by the time you spend for her/him
   - Your pet will be hungry if you’re not feeding it frequently
   - Your pet will not die by starvation, but it will be exhausted. If being so, it won’t be able to move or do anything, unless you save it by spending 35hrs(?) for a week
